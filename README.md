# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system
did they want you to design?
The owner of driverpass wants to design an application that will allow better drivers training then what is currently available.  
The owner of driver pass company is the client. The system has many features that will allow a student can create an account, and then the customer will have the 
ability to select the type of package they want. Online training, practive exams and road training will be available.

What did you do particularly well?
I did well with identifying the requirements of the requested application and providing the UML diagrams.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what
would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would continue work on the functional requirements and non-functional requirements. 
I think that these are very important to the project and I feel that I could provide more detail.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system
design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
First, I assesed the needs of the client and interperted these into requirements. Each requiremnt is then broken into pieces, this makes it easier when it comes time to code.  By detailing each specific piece of each requiremnt the the developers are better able to create meaningful functional code.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would
you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
If there is an existing version, then I would use that as my baseline to eithet add to or modify, to account for the new requirements. Having others test the application would also be important, this would be to ensure that nothing was missed and that all the functionality is correct.  The last thing I would do is ensure that a User Acceptance test was done so that the customer could actually use the software and ensure that this is what they want, this is also a time if the customer dosent like something them changes could be implemented.
